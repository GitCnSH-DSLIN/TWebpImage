# TWebpImage
Descendant of delphi class TGraphic for webp graphic file format. Includes animation.

Implementation of a new graphic class for Delphi's TGraphic class, for the webp graphic format (libwebp.dll 1.2.4). As far as I know, nothing similar exists yet. It can be a valid starting point to do something more professional.

It doesn't include the libwebp.dll library. You can download it precompiled in https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/download. If you don't know how to, just google for the library itself.

It's only for Windows, I don't think it would be too hard to adapt it for making something cross-platform with FPC.

Use of this, descenders or adaptations, is totally free for me, only subject to whether there may be something established for similar use by webp or windows or delphi format.
